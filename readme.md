# Fraud Detection Ensemble Model

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using an ensemble of machine learning models, with a special focus on the Major Voting Ensemble classifier. The goal is to leverage the strengths of multiple models to improve the prediction accuracy and reliability over using a single model approach.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project involves transactional data, where each transaction is labeled as either 'Normal' or 'Fraud'. Each record in the dataset contains features related to the transaction details. Note: Specific details about the dataset such as the source, features included, and any preprocessing steps should be described here.

## Models:

The notebook appears to use three different types of models: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Random Forest. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of each model and how they might be used in the context of fraud detection:

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):
CNNs are primarily known for their use in processing grid-like data such as images. However, they can also be effective for sequence data like time series or transactional data, where the locality and translation invariance of features can be beneficial. In fraud detection, CNNs can be used to identify patterns in sequences of transactions that might indicate fraudulent activity.

Artificial Neural Network (ANN):
ANNs are versatile systems that mimic the way human brains operate, allowing them to learn from large amounts of data. ANNs consist of layers of interconnected nodes or neurons, where each connection represents a weight. These weights are adjusted during training so that the network can predict the correct output. For fraud detection, ANNs can learn to distinguish between normal and fraudulent transactions by identifying complex patterns and relationships in the data.

Random Forest:
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) of the individual trees. It is particularly known for its high accuracy, robustness, and ease of use. In the context of fraud detection, Random Forest can handle a large volume of data with numerous variables, capturing important indicators of fraudulent activity without the need for feature scaling.


Majority Voting Ensembler: 
Majority Voting Ensemble is a popular ensemble technique that combines the predictions of multiple individual models to make a final prediction. In Majority Voting, each model in the ensemble gets a vote, and the final prediction is determined by the majority of votes.
